// ── useDrillSession — the shared drill-session facade ─────────────────────
//
// A thin wrapper around useGameEngine that both Practice and (later) Game run
// a drill through:
//
//     DrillConfig → useDrillSession → { …session state/actions, result }
//
// It does not reimplement any drill logic — question generation, pickSmartFret,
// the shuffle-bag/coverage pool, byFret/byNote flow, notesMatch, remainingFrets,
// timers, scoring, streaks, the timing ramp, history writes and Auto Advance's
// `onComplete` all still live in useGameEngine / useScoring / useHistory.
// This hook only:
//   • translates the platform-neutral DrillConfig into the engine's `settings`,
//   • fills in the setters the engine takes but the app never drives (only the
//     asked-string setter is real today),
//   • exposes a `result: SessionResult` derived from the session score + the
//     drill's recorded history.
//
// The engine's own `start / stop / pause / resume / selectFret / selectAnswer`
// and all of its render state are re-exposed unchanged.
