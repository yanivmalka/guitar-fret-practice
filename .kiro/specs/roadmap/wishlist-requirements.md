# Guitar Fret Practice — Roadmap

Based on everything we discussed, here's the full roadmap organized by version.

---

## v1.0 — "Ready to Ship"

Polished core experience. No rough edges. Worth showing to the guitar community.

### Core Game

- Balanced questioning: all notes covered approximately evenly, failed notes re-queued once
- Stage progression: dots → natural → chromatic per string, clock method
- Adaptive suggestion: auto-suggest harder/easier based on accuracy
- Per-stage history and stats (localStorage)

### Settings Menu (new design)

- String selector: 6, 5, 4, 3 | 2, 1, Multi (low strings first)
- Frets: preset buttons (0-12, 12-21) + Custom toggle with +/- controls
- Question Type: By Fret / By Note
- Filter: Whole Only, Dot Frets, then ♯/♭ on second line (disabled when Whole Only)
- Notes (By Note mode): toggleable per-note selection, at least 1 required
- Circle Order (By Fret mode): By String (independent toggle) + Fifths/Alpha (radio)
- Time: 3s, 4s, 5s, 7s, 10s
- Note Names: A B C / Do Re Mi (solfege with ♭ symbol)
- Custom Stage section at bottom: rename + clear

### Stage Navigation

- Chevron arrows ‹ › (distinct from play ▶ button)
- Progress bar with per-string colored dashes
- Tap title → stage picker overlay (grouped headers, jump to first step)
- Title glows on stage change
- Swipe left/right to change stage (horizontal only, bounds-checked)
- Stage change always stops game

### Custom Stage

- When settings don't match built-in stage → "Custom Stage" mode
- Shows custom name in progress title
- Snapshot saved to localStorage, restorable from picker
- Rename and Clear buttons in settings menu
- Free user: 1 custom stage

### UX Polish

- Haptics: correct (short pulse), wrong (double pulse), stage change (medium), tap (micro)
- Click sound on ALL buttons (oscillator burst, no audio file)
- Fret button: no lingering color, glow clears 400ms after click
- No zoom, no scrollbars, app feels native
- Settings as floating burger menu overlay (tap outside to dismiss)
- Toggle buttons have dashed border (distinguishable before click)
- ? info button at bottom center, auto-dismisses after 3s
- Refresh ↻ icon near version number
- Question sound stops immediately when user answers
- Order switcher placeholder prevents layout jump between modes

### Onboarding

- First launch: instrument choice (Guitar / Bass "coming soon")
- Level: Beginner → Stage 1 / Experienced → 3-question placement test
- Skip always available
- Never shows again after completing
